# Simon | UBC Launch Pad JavaScript Interview Project

## Getting Started

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Direct your browser to http://0.0.0.0:8000/.
Set `simon_on = false` in `simon.js` to try the button echo functionality.

## Notes

+ I am not a frontend Javascript developer! I am capable with a variety of
languages, and prefer backend work, data engineering and data science.

+ I am particularly interested in your Moonshot project. Please consider me!
